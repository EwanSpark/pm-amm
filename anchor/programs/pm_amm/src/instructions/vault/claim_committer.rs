//! Binary vault claim — option C (committers = LPs), audit #6.
//!
//! The Paradigm pm-AMM is an LP-vs-traders AMM: there is no self-funded
//! "bettor" whose losing stake could strand. A commitment vault is just a way
//! to CROWD-BOOTSTRAP that AMM, so committers are LPs. `launch_vault_market`
//! deposits the whole committed pot as liquidity (fully collateralized via the
//! max-reserve calibration, fix #1) and sets `total_lp_shares = total commit`.
//! This instruction hands each committer their pro-rata slice as a real
//! `LpPosition` (1 USDC committed = 1 LP share).
//!
//! Checkpoints are 0 (the launch baseline), so a committer earns their share of
//! all `dC_t` residuals accrued since launch — their capital was in the pool
//! from the start. The accumulator is normalized by `total_lp_shares` (set to
//! the full committed total at launch), so unclaimed slices stay correctly
//! accounted until their owner materializes this position.
//!
//! After claiming, a committer is a normal LP: `claim_lp_residuals`,
//! `withdraw_liquidity` (YES+NO out), `redeem_pair`, and post-resolution
//! `claim_winnings` on whatever they hold. Nothing is stranded; the winning
//! side is always fully backed (fix #1).
//!
//! Pre-launch the recovery path is `refund_commit`; once launched it's this.
